The problem lies in how the infinite list `ones` is handled.  To fix this, we must ensure that we process a finite portion of the list explicitly:

```haskell
import Data.List (unfoldr)

ones :: [Integer]
ones = unfoldr (\_ -> Just (1, ())) []

processOnes :: [Integer] -> Integer
processOnes xs = sum $ take 10 xs -- force evaluation with $ 

main :: IO ( )
main = print (processOnes ones)
```
The solution explicitly forces evaluation of `take 10 xs` using the `$` operator which ensures that only the first 10 elements of the `ones` list are processed, preventing the infinite loop.  Alternatively, one could use `take 10 ones` directly in the `sum` function call without the `$` operator. The key is to make sure that only a finite portion of the list is evaluated.
