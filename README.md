This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming related to lazy evaluation. The `bug.hs` file contains code that results in an infinite loop due to the improper handling of an infinite list generated using lazy evaluation. The `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version of the code demonstrating how to avoid this problem.
