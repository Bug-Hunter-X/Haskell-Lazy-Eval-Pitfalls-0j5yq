The following Haskell code snippet demonstrates a common error related to lazy evaluation and infinite loops:

```haskell
import Data.List (unfoldr)

-- This function generates an infinite list of 1s
ones :: [Integer]
ones = unfoldr (
_ -> Just (1, ())) []

-- This function attempts to process the infinite list
processOnes :: [Integer] -> Integer
processOnes xs = sum (take 10 xs) -- take the first 10 elements and sum them up

main :: IO ( )
main = print (processOnes ones)
```
This will lead to the program getting stuck in an infinite loop. The `ones` function generates an infinite list and `take` is lazy, it only evaluates as needed. Since `sum` needs all elements, it keeps on evaluating the `ones` list indefinitely.
